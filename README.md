# C++ 2D Self driving car project with neural network and genetic algorithms
This project uses one of the heuristic algorithm --- Genetic Algorithm combines with Artifical Neural Networks (ANN) to train the self driving car learning how to drive in the 2d track. Traditionally, Adjusting the weights and bias of neural network layers goes through backpropagation. Backpropagation is a gradient-based optimization method used to train artificial neural networks, adjusting network weights based on the error rate.
Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are evolutionary algorithms that search for optimal solutions by simulating natural selection, which can be used to optimize both neural network weights and even the network architecture itself.
This project uses Genetic Algorithms to search for the global optima of neural network layer. With more iterations, the car equipped with neural network could find the better way to drive on the track without deviating from runway.<br/><br/>
